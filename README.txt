This is a simply applet I mostly put together when I was first learning java.

It calculates the probability of a starting Magic:The Gathering hand having a specified
number of lands.I have added the ability to specify a range of target lands in hand,
 the max defaults to the min if it is not specfied (giving you the prob for exactly the number). 

 There is some sanity checking of the inputs but I havent gone
 through the effort of covering all cases,if you give silly inputs you may get a silly answer.
