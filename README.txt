This is a simply applet I put together when I was first learning java, its was largely a
 learning exercise but it may be useful for someone out there.

It calculates the probability of a starting Magic:The Gathering hand having a specified
number of lands using the hypergeometric distribution.


There is some sanity checking of the inputs but I have not gone through the effort of covering all cases, so if you give silly inputs you may get a silly answer.
