This is a simply applet I put together when I was first learning java, its was largely a
 learning exercise but it may be useful for someone out there.

It calculates the probability of a starting Magic:The Gathering hand having a specified
number of lands using the hypergeometric distribution.

It has the ability to specify a range of target lands in hand, say between 3-5 lands, the max defaults to the min if it is not specfied. 

 There is some sanity checking of the inputs but I have not gone through the effort of covering all cases,if you give silly inputs you may get a silly answer.
